6. Alteryx connector, generate ids based on desctiptions
7. Audit usecase: Testing the control description: is the description HORNET?
8. Audit usecase: Can we finetune a model on IFRS17 to give better answers to IFRS17 related questions. Specifically journal entries. Bonus: can we make it generate IFRS17 knowledge questions.
